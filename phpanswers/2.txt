WP Super cache can use 3 approaches to cache:
- mod_revrite
- php (without init WP Core)
- legacy

In all cases this plugin write it's cache in filesystem.
For 3 equal servers ... name of cache file will be same (md5 from url)

So to revalidate it's cache we have 2 options:
1. Write additional stuff that let us notify other servers to remove file by it's key (name of file) when we update post.
2. Use additional tool to sync this folders. (As codes / database / servers are same ...
that's means that cache folder should contain same files). For example: Unison File Synchronizer

But in case of use load balancer ... better option would be to use one shared Memcached instance.
So in this situation ... we should use another caching plugin, like W3 Total Cache or Batcache.
